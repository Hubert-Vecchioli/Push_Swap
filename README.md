Program that sorts (in ascending order) a stack containing numbers passed as arguments.

The program can only use certain operations, which are printed in the terminal once executed.
Please refer to the project subject for more details.

Use `make` to compile the program into an executable push_swap.
Then run `./push_swap` followed by the numbers to sort.
